# Linux-Commands-and-Grep-RegEx ðŸ’»

This is an assignment I did on Linux commands and grep regex.

Grep is a powerful tool to extract information from large quantities of data. 

[f1.txt](https://github.com/SHussain84/Linux-Commands-and-Grep-RegEx/blob/main/f1.txt) is the file I used to perform Grep on.
